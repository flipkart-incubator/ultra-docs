##Purpose
OMS V2 is a view layer maintained by flipkart for orders placed on ultra platform. The OMS lite layer will act as a data source for flipkartâ€™s my order page as well as CX agents.

OMS V2 has a check for idempotency meaning that any Order state that is accepted successfully will not be accepted again

More information on how to make the API calls to OMS is [here](backend.md#oms)

###Reconciliation Report DOWNLOAD

Once we receive a recon report from a partner, we process and generate Reconciled Report and send it via email back to the partner. The Reconciled Report has the difference between the orders in Flipkart OMS and the partners OMS. Once the partner receives the document, they download it and replay the mismatched orders. All the effort here is manual and we would like to help to automate this entire process. Hence as part of it, we are creating an API where partners can run a cron job and pull the Reconciled Report through an API and all mismatches can be reconciled by replaying the events. 


Description of the API: 
```
GET https://platform.flipkart.net/2/oms/recon/report/download
HEADER 
secureToken : JWT_TOKEN

Response: 
Status : 200
Body: Success
Attachment: CSV-file

Failure for invalid secure token:
Status : 401 Unauthorized
Body : 	Unauthorized
```
