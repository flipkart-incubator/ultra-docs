We present to you a special feature called known as the Ultra playground where you can gain more knowledge and experiment with the Ultra APIs experimenting with the APIs. Follow the below steps for playing around:

* Install the Flipkart application on your Android smartphone.
* Click on [this link](https://www.flipkart.com/ultra/?clientId=playground) through your smartphone. It will open the Ultra playground within Flipkart.
* Then, it will open [this page](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within the Ultra container where you can check out different JavaScript APIs exposed to Ultra. Please note that this page will not work outside the container.

If you want a glimpse of the code running behind the scenes, open this [playground application](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within the browser and you can use "Inspect" of Chrome browser to view the code.
