## Ulta Demo

We present to you a special feature known as the Ultra playground for experimenting with the APIs. To explore this, follow these steps:

* Install the Flipkart application on your Android smartphone.
* Click on [this link](https://www.flipkart.com/ultra/?clientId=playground) through your smartphone. It will open the Ultra playground within Flipkart.
* Then, it will open [this page](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within the Ultra container where you can check out different JavaScript APIs exposed to Ultra. Please note that this page will not work outside the container.

If you want a glimpse of the code running behind the scenes, open this [playground application](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within the browser and you can use "Inspect" of Chrome browser to view the code.
