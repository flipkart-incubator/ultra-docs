# Ultra Demo 

We present to you a special feature called `The Ultra playground` where you can get your hands dirty while playing around with the Ultra APIs.

Here are the steps to follow for experiencing this playground:

* Install the Flipkart application on your Android smartphone.
* Click on [this link](https://www.flipkart.com/ultra/?clientId=playground) through your smartphone. It opens the Ultra playground within Flipkart app.
* Open [this page](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within the Ultra's container where you can look into the different JavaScript APIs exposed to Ultra. 

!!!note
    Please note that this page does not work outside Ultra's container.

If you want a glimpse of the code running behind the scenes, open the [playground application](https://ultra-playground.herokuapp.com/) within your browser and use "Inspect" feature to see the real code.
