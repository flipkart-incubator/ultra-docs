# Welcome to Ultra

Ultra is an application development platform within Flipkart application offering an open window for external companies or organizations that are existing or may want to become Flipkart business partners. Ultra will help Flipkart’s business associates in offering a development platform for merging their applications within Flipkart application and provide a variety of services to the customers. It will help Flipkart customers to get access to a single shopping destination. It is an idea designed to pave new ways for users to interact with any external application within Flipkart with security and trust. This can help Flipkart business partners (such as, MakeMyTrip, Phone Pe and so on) in getting closer to one of the largest user base in the country by opening their services like booking tickets, bill payments and others for the users. It will further help Flipkart present an ultimate shopping experience to its customers by launching convenience services such as online ticketing, online payment of bills, so on and by including more business categories indirectly into its domain.

Ultra involves on-boarding of the companies or organizations who specialise in the categories like travel ticket reservations, booking online movie tickets, paying online bills and more to improve their customer base through Flipkart. Ultra redirects a user to the partner application within Flipkart and grants the entry based on the user’s Flipkart login credentials after seeking permissions from the user to share the data further. Post the successful transactions between the user and the partner, the user can check the status of these activities in Flipkart application.

Using Ultra as a development platform will allow Flipkart partners to open their doors to over 100 million handhelds in the country. Ultra supports a wide variety of technologies from the most basic web applications to very advanced technologies powered by React Native, thus, provides ample room to grow and develop unique skills while keeping entry barrier low such that it’s not overwhelming.

# Why Ultra

In an ever increasing mobile internet economy and with limited storage space on devices, users find it hard to get continued and seamless access to different services. With Flipkart having one of the largest user base in the country, building a distribution platform to host services offered by other non-competing players can help users get access to a one-stop destination.

Users transact on multiple platforms today e.g. travel booking, movie ticket booking, etc. Thus, Ultra leverages Flipkart’s developer platform to offer turnkey integrations for identity, communication channels and others to make users’ experience with partner applications more seamless and engaging and giving them the ability to have Flipkart as a single destination.

Partners build the applications providing services to the users but using Ultra, users need not to install, open and sign-up before experiencing the partners’ services for the first time thus making the partner’s service more accessible and doing away with a major adoption barrier. A lot of key technology advancements come out of the box for partners to integrate with, thus giving users more reasons to transact. 

With Ultra, we want to create a single unique transaction identity for the user. Flipkart can increase its portfolio of offerings, categories with thin margins (e.g. phone recharges, flight bookings etc.) which make it infeasible for Flipkart to enter that category. The other service is to offer smaller ticket size purchases that are more frequent (e.g. phone recharges, movie tickets) that can get new users to try out Flipkart thus helping us gain new customers. Knowing what and how users spend on other platforms can improve our own offerings.
