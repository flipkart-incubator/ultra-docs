# Welcome to Ultra
We are pleased to announce the launch of version 1 of Ultra Platform on Android App. With this launch, we take a leap forward towards a vision of becoming a single shopping destination for all customer needs. This effort also brings us to a place where we can enable faster learnings for us on not-so-known shopping categories like Travel & Food, as well as non-shopping categories like Video and Music. It’s an idea which is designed to pave new ways for users to interact with any 3rd party App within Flipkart App securely and with trust. Hence, Ultra and its meaning ( Revolution) has become synonymous and is consecrated by usage.
