# Welcome to Ultra

Ultra is an application development platform that enables external service providers such as MakeMyTrip and Phone Pe (we call them partners in Ultra) to host their application services on Flipkart. It helps Flipkart customers to securely access a variety of online convenience services such as online ticketing and payment of bills. The platform is scalable to include other business categories into Flipkart domain.

It involves on-boarding of partners’ applications which specialise in the categories like travel ticket reservations, booking online movie tickets, paying online bills, etc. to improve their customer base through Flipkart. 

Ultra redirects a user to a partner’s application within Flipkart app window. The entry in the partner’s app is allowed based upon the user’s login credentials and the permissions that are granted by the users for sharing their data further. The users and the partner carry out all transactions through the Flipkart payment gateway (FKPG). After successful transactions, the user is able to check the status of the placed orders within Flipkart app.

Using Ultra as a development platform, helps our partners to open their doors to over 100 million handhelds in the country. Ultra supports a wide variety of technologies from the most basic web applications to very advanced technologies powered by React Native, thus, provides ample room to grow and develop unique skills while keeping entry barrier low such that it does not feel overwhelming.


# Why Ultra
In an ever increasing mobile internet economy and with limited storage space on devices, users find it hard to get continued and seamless access to a wide variety of services. With Flipkart having one of the largest user base in the country, building a distribution platform to host services offered by other non-competing players helps users in getting access to a one-stop destination for all of their needs.

Users transact on multiple facilities today e.g. travel booking, movie ticket booking, etc. Ultra leverages Flipkart’s developer platform to offer turnkey integrations for identity, payments, communication channels and others to make a user's experience with external applications more seamless and engaging. Now, users need not to worry about downloading, installing and signing-up a different app for experiencing such facilities. Thus, it makes these applications more accessible doing away with a major adoption barrier. Moreover, a lot of key technology advancements come out of the box for the external organizations to integrate with, giving users additional reasons to transact.

With Ultra, Flipkart wants to create a single unique transaction identity for it's users. Furthermore, Flipkart can increase its portfolio of offerings by introducing new categories like phone recharges, flight bookings etc. for the convenience of it's users.
