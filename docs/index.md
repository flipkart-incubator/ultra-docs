# Welcome to Ultra

Ultra is a platform that aims at providing Flipkart customers with shopping experiences on categories that Flipkart does not handle. It is an idea designed to pave new ways for users to interact with any external application within Flipkart with security and trust. With Flipkart having one of the largest user base in the country, building a distribution platform to host experiences or services (for example, booking tickets, bill payments) offered by other non-competing players (such as, MakeMyTrip, Phone Pe and so on) can help customers get access to a single shopping destination and helping developers get wider access while Flipkart gets a greater share of the user’s wallet.

Ultra involves on-boarding partners who specialise in these categories. It redirects users to partner experiences within the Flipkart app and grants the entry into these experiences based on Flipkart user login and makes payments for these orders using Flipkart’s payment gateway. If users want to check the status of these orders, they can do that using Flipkart’s My Orders page.

Ultra will help partners and businesses by allowing them to integrate their applications within Flipkart’s android application using developer friendly APIs and open doors to over 100 million handhelds in the country. The developers do not want to miss a chance of working with Ultra platform as it supports a wide variety of technologies from the most basic web applications to very advanced experiences powered by React Native. This provides ample room to grow and develop unique skills while keeping entry barrier low such that it’s not overwhelming. Ultra’s vision is to be a prestigious developer platform enabling cutting edge experiences to its users.

# Why Ultra

In an ever increasing mobile internet economy and with limited storage space on devices, users find it hard to get continued and seamless access to different services offered by developers. With Flipkart having one of the largest user base in the country, building a distribution platform to host experiences and services offered by other non-competing players can help users get access to a one-stop destination and helping developers get wider access while Flipkart enjoys getting a greater share of the user’s wallet and hence enhancing its top of mind recall.

Users transact on multiple platforms today e.g. travel booking, movie ticket booking, etc. Thus, Ultra leverages Flipkart’s developer platform to offer turnkey integrations for identity, payments, communication channels and others to make users’ experience with partner applications more seamless and engaging and giving them the ability to have Flipkart as a one-stop destination.

Partners build the applications providing services to the users and using Ultra, users need not to install, open and sign-up before experiencing the partners’ services for the first time thus making the partner’s service more accessible and doing away with a major adoption barrier. A lot of key technology advancements come out of the box for partners to integrate with, thus giving users more reasons to transact. 

With Ultra, we want to create a single unique transaction identity for the user. Flipkart can increase its portfolio of offerings, categories with thin margins (e.g. phone recharges, flight bookings etc.) which make it infeasible for Flipkart to enter that category. The other service is to offer smaller ticket size purchases that are more frequent (e.g. phone recharges, movie tickets) that can get new users to try out Flipkart thus helping us gain new customers. Knowing what and how users spend on other platforms can improve our own offerings.
