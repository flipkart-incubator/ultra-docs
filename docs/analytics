# Ultra Client Side Analytics SDK Documentation

## Overview

This part of SDK helps developers send user generated events to Ultra Platform.

### Category - Travel

#### Search Event

To send user generated search events, first import Travel module from fk-platform-sdk/analytics
```js
import {Travel} from "fk-platform-sdk/analytics";
```

Create a search object by passing following arguments
a.	Source location: String
	This will be starting location for flight/bus and the location of hotel in case of hotel booking.
b.	Destination location: String[]
	This array should contain destination location for flights/bus. Incase there are intermediate locations they should came in same array in order.
	This field can be empty for hotel booking.
c.	Date: Date[]
	This will contain array of dates for multi city travel. For hotel booking this will be start and end date of hotel reservation.
d.	(Optional) RoundTrip: boolean
	True if it is a round trip
e. (Optional) Traveller Count: Number
```js
const search = new Travel.Search("bangalore", ["delhi"], [new Date()], false, 1);
```
Finally, get analytics module from fkPlatform and push the event. If the event is invalid then an error level log will be printed on console.
```js
fkPlatform.getModuleHelper().getAnalyticsModule().pushEvent(search);
```
