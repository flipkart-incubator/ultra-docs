# Why Ultra

In an ever increasing mobile internet economy and with limited storage space on devices, users find it hard to get continued and seamless access to different services. With Flipkart having one of the largest user base in the country, building a distribution platform to host services offered by other non-competing players can help users get access to a one-stop destination.

Users transact on multiple platforms today e.g. travel booking, movie ticket booking, etc. Thus, Ultra leverages Flipkart’s developer platform to offer turnkey integrations for identity, payments, communication channels and others to make users’ experience with external applications more seamless and engaging.

Now, users need not to worry about downloading a new app, installing it and signing-up for experiencing these external services for the first time thus making the applications more accessible and doing away with a major adoption barrier. A lot of key technology advancements come out of the box for the external organizations to integrate with, thus giving users more reasons to transact. 

With Ultra, we want to create a single unique transaction identity for the user. Flipkart can increase its portfolio of offerings, categories with thin margins (e.g. phone recharges, flight bookings etc.) which make it infeasible for Flipkart to enter that category. The other service is to offer smaller ticket size purchases that are more frequent (e.g. phone recharges, movie tickets) that can get new users to try out Flipkart thus helping us gain new customers. Knowing what and how users spend on other platforms can improve our own offerings.
